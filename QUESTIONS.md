# QUESTIONS.md — append-only decision log (Decision Protocol)

Format: `[Q-nnn] question → default chosen → rationale → refactor cost if reversed (S/M/L)`.
Grouped by phase. This file is the Phase 15 review agenda.

## Phase 0

- [Q-001] Migration tooling: drizzle-kit forward-only vs reversible pairs? → **Hand-authored
  up/down SQL pairs + ~100-line runner** → plan hard-requires up→down→up in CI (1.16);
  drizzle-kit cannot express down migrations → **M**
- [Q-002] Node 20 (plan) vs Node 24 (rest of recent suite)? → **Node 20 LTS in Docker,
  engines >=20** → plan-pinned; no >20 APIs used, so a later bump is a one-line change → **S**
- [Q-003] Admin UI exposure: Caddy subdomain vs LAN-only port? → **Caddy subdomain `airouter`
  for the admin UI only; app-facing API never routed through Caddy** (internal docker DNS) →
  smallest public surface consistent with "non-technical admin can use a browser" → **S**
- [Q-004] Dev DB host ports? → **55433/56380** → 1099 dev stack owns 55432/56379; both stacks
  must run simultaneously during Phase 12 TB/app migrations → **S**
